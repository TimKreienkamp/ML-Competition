Predict the type of forest cover from cartographic variables

Variables:

Quantitative
1.	Elevation /meters / Elevation in meters 
2.	Aspect / azimuth / Aspect in degrees azimuth 
3.	Slope / degrees / Slope in degrees 
4.	Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology / meters / Horz Dist to nearest surface water features 
5.	Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology / meters / Vert Dist to nearest surface water features 
6.	Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways / meters / Horz Dist to nearest roadway 
7.	Hillshade_9am / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at 9am, summer solstice 
8.	Hillshade_Noon / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at noon, summer soltice 
9.	Hillshade_3pm / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solstice 
10.	Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points // meters / Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition points 

Qualitative
11.	Wilderness_Area (4 binary columns) / qualitative / 0 (absence) or 1 (presence) / Wilderness area designation 
12.	Soil_Type (40 binary columns) / qualitative / 0 (absence) or 1 (presence) / Soil Type designation

Integer (To be predicted)
13.	Cover_Type (7 types) / integer / 1 to 7 / Forest Cover Type designation 30 x 30 meter cell
•	Spruce/Fir (1)
•	Lodgepole Pine (2)
•	Ponderosa Pine (3)
•	Cottonwood/Willow (4)
•	Aspen (5)
•	Douglas-fir (6),
•	Krummholz (7)

Data:
Subset of:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype
Training data: 50000
Test data: 100000
 
Methods

Tree based methods:
•	Random forest
•	Gradient boosting

Other:
•	SVM
•	KNN

Next step:
•	Sync github
•	Data viz
•	Features ?

Other information:
Article:
•	The results of the comparison indicated that a feedforward artificial neural network (ann) model more accurately predicted forest cover type than did a traditional statistical model based on Gaussian discriminant analysis.

Features:
•	Distance to nearest surface water = feature sqrt(horizontal^2 +vertical ^2)
•	Combined variable with slope and sunlight (possibly already included in the sunlight variable)
•	Tested for predictive value in article and adopted or dropped in the analysis:
•	Horizontal distance to the nearest wildfire ignition point
•	Wilderness area designation
•	Soil type designation
•	Creating a variable of the forrest type located next to you
